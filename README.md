# Introduction to Weather Dashboard 
======================================
1. Hello
- Hello & welcome to my Weather Dashboard, where you can search for the current forecast & five day forecasts of cities around the globe!

2. Description
- This application was developed to help the user check the current forecast for a given location, as well as what to expect over the next five days.

- Simply enter a valid city into the search engine, & you will be able to see the temperature, humidity, UV index, wind speed, and a bit about the current weather.

- Just below that, you are able to see what the next five days' worth of weather has in store for that given climate!

- There is also a saved city feature, which holds previously searched cities for you to revisit

3. Assets Used
- This project utilized a combination of HTML, CSS & Javascript to start, but also included the following:
  1. Bootstrap
  2. JQuery
  3. Moment.JS
  4. OpenWeather API
  
 4. Credit Due
 - Credit must be passed along to the various tutors, TA's & colleagues who assisted me in building this program!
